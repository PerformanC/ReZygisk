# [IMPROVE]: Stability and battery drain reduction

Enhanced the ReZygisk module with multiple optimizations to improve stability and reduce battery drain:

1. Memory Management:
   - Added proper cleanup for dynamically allocated memory
   - Implemented NULL pointer checks
   - Improved error handling for memory allocation

2. Socket Handling:
   - Implemented socket timeouts to prevent hanging
   - Added proper closure and error handling
   - Implemented polling with timeouts to prevent CPU spinning

3. Thread Management:
   - Added proper thread detachment and cleanup
   - Implemented thread tracking to clean up zombie threads
   - Added signal handling for timeouts

4. Signal Handling:
   - Added handlers for graceful shutdown
   - Implemented SIGALRM and SIGPIPE handling
   - Improved overall signal management

5. Caching:
   - Added UID permission caching in KernelSU implementation
   - Implemented thread-safe cache access with mutex
   - Added timeout-based cache invalidation

6. Process Priority:
   - Set appropriate priorities to reduce CPU usage
   - Implemented I/O priority settings
   - Added batch scheduling for background operations

These changes make the module more stable and efficient, particularly on devices with limited resources.

## Files Modified
- `zygiskd/src/zygiskd.c`: Improved daemon functionality with better resource management
- `zygiskd/src/companion.c`: Enhanced companion module with optimized event handling
- `zygiskd/src/utils.c`: Optimized utility functions for better performance
- `zygiskd/src/utils.h`: Added new function declarations for improved resource management
- `zygiskd/src/root_impl/common.c`: Enhanced common root implementation with better resource handling
- `zygiskd/src/root_impl/common.h`: Updated header file with necessary types and includes
- `zygiskd/src/root_impl/kernelsu.c`: Implemented caching and optimized KernelSU implementation

## Testing
The changes have been tested on multiple devices with different root implementations (KernelSU, Magisk, APatch) to ensure compatibility and stability. Battery usage monitoring shows a significant reduction in drain compared to the previous implementation.

## Impact
These improvements should make the ReZygisk module more stable and efficient, particularly on devices with limited resources. Users should experience fewer crashes, better responsiveness, and improved battery life.
